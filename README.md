# DNS-Exfiltration-DGA-Detection
This project focuses on detecting advanced network threats that bypass traditional firewalls by using the DNS protocol. Using the **Splunk BOTS v3 dataset**, I developed a detection engine to identify **Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA)** and **DNS Tunneling/Exfiltration** attempts.
